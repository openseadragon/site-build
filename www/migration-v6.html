<h2>Migration From v5 to v6</h2>

<p>
Version 6 brings in OpenSeadragon major change of how is data handled. In general, you
should familiarize yourself with the <a href="/#data-modification-pipeline">new system</a> of data handling.

Below is a list of things that the new system deprecates:

<ul style="list-style-type: disc">
    <li>
        tiles can only contain cache objects, <code>Tile</code> data properties like <code>image</code>,
        <code>getImage</code>, <code>getCanvasContext</code>, <code>context2D</code>, <code>cacheImageRecord</code>,
        are deprecated and might not even work as expected
    </li>
    <li>
        tiles do not care what is the underlying drawer, properties like
        <code>element</code>, <code>style</code> are deprecated; you can use <code>tile-invalidated</code>
        event to access these inside the cache item when <code>HTMLDrawer</code> is being used
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>tile-drawing</code> event is deprecated, since data modification logics can
        perform asynchronous operations, and this event was performed synchronously just before drawing
        a particular element
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>TileSource</code>-driven data management is deprecated (like <code>createTileCache</code>), since not the tile source, but the
        core system decides how, when and what to do with the data; if you've overridden <code>downloadTileStart</code>
        you need to newly provide what <i>type</i> of the data you submit to the system
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Example usage of new way of data modification:
</p>
<pre>
viewer.addHandler('tile-invalidated', async e => {
    const data = await e.getData('context2d');
    if (e.outdated()) return;
    e.setData(myValue, 'context2d');
});

viewer.requestInvalidate().then(() => console.log("Viewport updated!"));
</pre>
<p>
    Cool, right?
