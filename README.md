# OpenSeadragon Site-Build

This project compiles static web pages which provide the examples and documentation for using OpenSeadragon.

## On the Web

http://openseadragon.github.io/

## First Time Setup

All command-line operations are scripted using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) which is based on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). To get set up:

1. Install Node, if you haven't already (available at the link above)
1. Install the Grunt command line runner (if you haven't already); on the command line, run `npm install -g grunt-cli`
1. Clone the site-build repository
1. On the command line, go in to the site-build folder
1. Run `npm install`

You're set... continue reading for build and test instructions.

## Building the Web Pages

To build, just run (on the command line, in the site-build folder):

    grunt build

The built website will appear in site-build/build.

If you want to try the site out in your browser, you can run:
    
    grunt connect watch

This will run a server at http://localhost:9000/.

## Building the Docs

    grunt doc

... will build the docs into the local build folder.

## Publishing

To publish, run:

    grunt publish

This cleans out the openseadragon.github.com folder (which you've cloned from the openseadragon.github.com repository, and resides next to your site-build folder) and builds and copies the web pages and docs into it.

Note that while the OpenSeadragon website resides at http://openseadragon.github.io, for historical reasons the repository is named openseadragon.github.com.

## Example Images

If you want to see the website with the appropriate example images, clone the example-images repository into site-build/build and check out its gh-pages branch.
